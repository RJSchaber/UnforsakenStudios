                        Hello! Unforsaken Studios team would like to introduce you to Anna Shishkareva. She’s from a freezing region in far Northern Russia, Noviy Urengoy, but now she lives in Saint Petersburg, which is still in far Northern Russia, but not as far. There is a long list of what makes Anna happy, especially if it involves music and creating/decorating. Music has always been a source of inspiration for Anna. She has an eclectic taste of music ranging from metal, rock, and punk to classic, ambient, and the oldies (20s-60s). What she listens to really depends on her mood, but she tends to lean more towards metal and punk. Anna is currently in the making of starting her own band. Hopefully, her neighbors won’t mind her singing. Anna also loves to create decorations by hand, sew, knit, poker-work, draw, and take care of her little home garden. The process of creating something out of nothing makes her super happy.</p>

                    <p class="bio">Since Anna grew up in the colder parts of Russia, she had many canceled school days that allowed her to dabble in practically every type of hobby. Most of all, she loved to play games on those days where the weather dropped down to -40C to -60C. She was obsessed with playing the Sims series! With Anna it wasn’t so much that she was interested with the people, but rather the creation of her online world. She constantly deleted old houses and created new ones. At only 9 years-old, she found a way to alter people’s appearances and created her family within the game. Because of Sims, Anna realized what she wanted to do when she got older. It wasn’t too long before she moved on to playing Doom, Painkiller, and Suffering and RPG games like TES, Disciples, along with other dark horror games. Something about the atmosphere and artistic locations of the games really drew her in.

                    <p class="bio">
                        Although Anna had a passion for the gamedev industry, she wasn’t a programmer and thought that being an artist wouldn’t be enough to get her foot through the door. She ended up going through art school and then moved to Saint Petersburg to study graphic arts to draw and paint illustrations for books. Anna was on her way to shelf her gaming aspirations and become an illustrator for children’s books when she saw a gamedev task announcement by chance. It was Planton from Elverils, which Ray was working for at that time. They started one project together and then our crazy years of gamedev and amazing friendships ensued. We have created a family within our little network that works together to create make awesome inspirational things!

                    <h1 class="secondHeader">Note from Anna:</h1>
                    
                    <p class="bio">
                        I had an epiphany when I was working at a previous studio as an artist. No one should have to shelf their dreams and aspirations and settle for a different job, even if it pays the bills and a little extra. If you don’t feel happy at your job, then be brave and take a chance to pave your way to what you want. There are plenty of treasures in this life is you aren’t afraid to get out of your comfort zone and take on a personal quest. I found my treasures with my friends at Unforsaken Studios when we create worlds out of nothing, and, through that, change our world.
